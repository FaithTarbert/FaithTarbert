### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Faith!
#### I'm a certified Full Stack Developer, who loves to code. I am looking to join a team, project or company that uses their tech superpowers for good. 

Current Skills: JavaScript | Express | MongoDB | REACT | Firebase | HTML | CSS | And more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working/learning Ruby on Rails via AWS Cloud9 Services (I'm deploying a video learning, eCom platform).

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: faithchendrickson at gmail com
- âš¡ Fun fact: To take time away from screen and etherland, I'm a mixed media artist. This means getting paint under your nails, shredding perfectly good fabric and paper and generally feeling gleeful about creating messes.
