### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Faith!
#### I'm a Full Stack Developer, who loves to code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working/learning Ruby on Rails via AWS Cloud9 Services (I'm deploying a video learning, eCom platform).

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: faithchendrickson at gmail com
- âš¡ Fun fact: To take time away from screen and etherland, I'm a mixed media artist. This means getting paint under your nails, shredding perfectly good fabric and paper and generally feeling gleeful about creating messes.
